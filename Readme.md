================================

Or how js-crypto can be an important part of this complete breakfast.
(When used in conjunction with https and other security measures)

Things to discuss:
* Encryption key is stored in #document-fragment and not sent to server.
* Granting access to a protected chat room is as easy as sharing the url.
* The host is somewhat protected from the data (Copyright, etc).
* The host can't be tempted to passively snoop. (Takes active script injection)
* If this is used as an API, consumers can host their own JS.
* This could be used (with CORS) to build a public CDN that checks assets before use.

Cool server shit:
* Server sent events using Nginx and Lua.

Things to fix:
* iPhone canvas problem?
* Needs responsive layout.
